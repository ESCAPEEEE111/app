The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic boilerplate into a full-stack digital marketing platform. Initially, it involved cloning a Matrix-themed Nowhere Digital website, implementing advanced animations, and integrating features like an AI chat system and admin dashboard. A significant pivot led to a cleaner, teal/cyan design with comprehensive pricing, removing many animations. The project then evolved into an ultimate all-in-one digital services platform, introducing an AI-Powered Problem Solver and a multi-page frontend architecture. The engineer systematically addressed critical bugs, including backend date handling, frontend  statement issues, and syntax errors in component files, notably fixing a recurring blank page issue caused by corrupted component code and CSS. The last efforts focused on implementing modern typography and animations across the site, followed by debugging persistent CSS errors that were still causing blank pages.
